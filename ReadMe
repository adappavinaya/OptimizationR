Problem/Assumptions:
A vendor has capacity of 50 pounds on which he can store : oranges and apples. To obtain these fruits, it costs the vendor $12 per pound for the oranges and $21 per pound for the apples. He has $1500 available for expenses.
He has storage space for 400 fruits. The net profit after expenses is $1.3 for oranges and $2 for apples. 
Every pound is about 11 oranges or 3 apples. 

How should he used the 50 pounds of capacity to maximize profit?
